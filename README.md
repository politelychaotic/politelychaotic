## About me

- Hacker | Security Researcher | SOC Analyst | Coder | Netrunner
- ðŸ”­ Recent Computer Engineering (BS) grad.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning offensive security with TryHackMe and HackTheBox. I am also scripting in my freetime in (Python, Bash, C/++), and working my way through Hands On Hacking by Matthew Hickey and Jennifer Arcuri, where I am pentesting a vulnerable mailserver VM, and Black Hat Python by Justin Seitz and Tim Arnold where I am working on my python scripting for terminal programs, and for building networking apps (especially for the purposes of pentesting and reconnaissance).
- Building a SOC Homelab setup with Wazuh and Suricata (with plans to extend Suricata with Lua).
